    <h1>Virginia Beach is weird...</h1>
    <h2>...but sometimes in very excellent ways!</h2>
    <p>Virginia Beach is a resort city with miles of beaches and hundreds of hotels, motels, and restaurants along its oceanfront. Every year the city hosts the East Coast Surfing Championships as well as the North American Sand Soccer Championship, a beach soccer tournament.</p>
    <p>It is also home to several state parks, several long-protected beach areas, military bases, a number of large corporations, Virginia Wesleyan University, Edgar Cayce's Association for Research and Enlightenment, and numerous historic sites. Near the point where the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean meet, Cape Henry was the site of the first landing of the English colonists, who eventually settled in Jamestown, on April 26, 1607.</p>
    <p>The city is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as having the longest pleasure beach in the world. It is located at the southern end of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, which was the world's longest bridge-tunnel complex until 2018, when the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge opened to traffic in the Cantonese Greater Bay Area.</p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Beach,_Virginia">- from Virginia Beach, Virginia on Wikipedia.org</a>
